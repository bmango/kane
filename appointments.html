          <p>To make an appointment please call the practice between 9am and 6pm Monday to Friday. Saturday 9.00am to 12.30pm. Outside these hours you can leave a message on our answer machine.&nbsp;<a href="/contact.html">Contact us here &gt;&gt;</a></p>
          <p><strong>Emergencies</strong></p>
          <p>If you are in acute pain we will do our best to offer you an appointment on the day you call. The message on the reception answer phone will have the current out of hours number.</p>
          <p><strong>Cancellations</strong></p>
          <p>Please give at least 24 hours notice for a cancellation or the full appointment fee will be payable.</p>
          <p><strong>Your first appointment</strong></p>
          <p>When you first visit the practice we will take a detailed case history about your present complaint, medical history and general health/lifestyle. We will also examine you and treat you. Using this information and a detailed knowledge of anatomy and physiology we will explain to you why the symptoms have presented themselves in the way that they have. A treatment plan, the likely time scale and expected outcome will be discussed.</p>
          <p>Please feel free to ask us any questions, no matter how trivial they seem. It is your body and if you understand why your symptoms exist this will aid in your return to recovery.</p>
          <p><strong>Medical insurance</strong></p>
          <p>The osteopaths at Kane and Ross are recognised  by all the major health insurers. But please note patients are no  longer&nbsp;reimbursed by AXA PPP Healthcare and BUPA (UK) as their terms have  substantially restricted the level of service osteopathic&nbsp;practices are  able to offer. Treatment with us can be covered by all the other major health  insurances, including BUPA&nbsp;International and AXA PPP International. Please  check with your insurers to establish your level of cover and any  requirements&nbsp;they may have, such as a referral letter from your doctor. We  will provide all relevant paperwork to ease the process of having&nbsp;your  fees reimbursed.<br />
            <br />
