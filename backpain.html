          <p> Back pain is something most of us will suffer at one time or another although  there is a world of difference between aching muscles or ligaments and the  raging pain from acute joint strain or&nbsp;prolapsed disc. &nbsp;It can occur  at any age but is more common from mid thirties to sixties.</p>
          <p> Your back is a complicated arrangement of supports and levers. The muscles,  tendons, ligaments and joints &nbsp;work in cooperation to provide support and  enable you to move. &nbsp;All these&nbsp;structures are <strong>prone to stresses  and strain</strong> which can lead to symptoms of back pain.</p>
          <p> At Kane and Ross your osteopath will take a detailed history and perform  clinical testing including osteopathic palpation to evaluate the state of the  muscles, tendons, ligaments and joints.&nbsp;&nbsp;With a proper understanding  of the causes and contributing factors <strong>a treatment regime will be initiated</strong> to alleviate your symptoms. &nbsp;There are many causes of back pain from  strained muscles&nbsp;to prolapsed intervertebral disc. &nbsp;Your treatment  regime will be<strong> individualised to address your specific symptoms </strong>as well  as any underlying imbalances.</p>
          <p> Not every case of back pain can be helped by osteopathic treatment and it is  important to identify when someone needs to be referred for a surgical opinion  or further investigations. &nbsp;At Kane&nbsp;and Ross we may use x-rays, scans  and blood work to establish whether your problem is likely to respond to  osteopathic treatment and what treatments or activities to avoid.</p>
          <p> Most cases of back pain can be helped if not cured by osteopathic  treatment.&nbsp;A range of gentle hands-on techniques are used<strong> to release  tension patterns and restrictions</strong> from very gentle  'cranial&nbsp;techniques', positional release, neuromuscular techniques to  manipulation where appropriate.</p>
          <p> Fast effective pain relief may be the first objective but we also want to<strong> identify underlying causes</strong>, whether that be poor work station set-up, lack  of exercise or even the wrong kind of exercise. &nbsp;Once we&nbsp;understand  what the causes or contributing factors are, we will work with you to put  together a manageable exercise regime - stretching, strengthening and  rebalancing muscle function.</p>
          <p> Our aim is to get you moving and in control rather than being controlled by  back pain.</p>
