          <p>Over the last 10 years we have seen the number or babies with flat  heads increasing.  Many paediatricians,  lactation consultants, and GP&rsquo;s are referring babies with flat head syndrome,  or restricted neck movement for our team of specialised osteopaths to assess  and treat.    </p>
          <p>Assessment of flat head syndrome is important: the earlier the  better. Early diagnosis reduces the osteopathic treatment that will be needed  and the amount of exercises required. A baby can be assessed from birth. If  there is restricted neck movement it can be treated immediately. Babies&rsquo; heads  are soft. If a baby lies in the same position it will develop flat head  syndrome. If there is a muscular restriction in the neck, the baby will always  lie to the same side and may not feed the same on both breasts.</p>

          <p>Signs that your baby may have Plagiocephaly:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Baby only lies to one side when asleep and awake</li>
            <li>Your baby&rsquo;s head is tilted upwards when lying to the side</li>
            <li>On turning the baby&rsquo;s head side to side, the shoulder lifts</li>
            <li>When your baby is on its stomach the body goes into a banana shape</li>
            <li>Your baby may also have feeding issues as latching or sucking can  be a problem </li>
            <li>Your baby may have a preference to use one hand</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you notice one or more of these signs, we advise an initial one  hour consultation, which would include an assessment of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>limitations in neck movement</li>
            <li>the flatness of your baby&rsquo;s head</li>
            <li>other issues such as colic, tongue-tie and any spinal issues which  can develop from inter-uterine compression.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The initial hour also involves treatment positioning advice and  provides individualised specialised exercises for you to do at home with your  baby. </p>
          <p>In cases where further treatment for Plagiocephaly is required, we  would provide a letter of diagnosis and treatment plan to your GP and/or  paediatrician.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Initial  treatment</strong> (2-3 weeks) aims to increase cervical spine rotation movement as  quickly as possible, this prevents further flatness developing as the baby  starts to move its neck and so does not always lie on the same side.  Treatment includes gentle structural  techniques, stretching and articulation of the neck as well as cranial  techniques.  </p>
          <p>Further postural advice at this stage would be given to carers.</p>
          <p>Over the first 2-3 weeks, two appointments per week are typical. Attendance  at clinic will reduce progressively after that. </p>
          <p><strong>Intermediate  treatment</strong> for flat head syndrome follows until the baby is sitting and  occipital ridge is protruding. This would involve side bending exercises and  strengthening exercises as well as more advanced hands-on techniques, through  the head, face, spine and pelvis if required.</p>
          <p>Finally <strong>longer term  treatment</strong> for Plagiocephaly would ensure neck musculature does not tighten  up and prevent a  scoliosis developing.  </p>
