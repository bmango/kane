              <p>Mark  Kane has spent more than 25 years as an osteopath helping patients from all  walks of life - pregnant mums, children, stressed execs and&nbsp;office  workers, parents and&nbsp;grandparents. &nbsp;On a daily basis, he treats pre  and post-natal&nbsp;women, sports injuries of kids and weekend warriors&nbsp;along  with the&nbsp;postural stresses and strains that go along with 21st century  living. &nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                His passion is for&nbsp;finding&nbsp;the underlying causes of his patients'  pain and devising effective strategies to&nbsp;get people&nbsp;onto the road to  recovery. &nbsp;The first step to effective treatment is accurate diagnosis and  Mark uses a wide range of&nbsp;clinical testing and will incorporate diagnostic  ultrasound within the osteopathic consultation where relevant. &nbsp;Ultrasound  can be particularly helpful in the diagnosis of soft&nbsp;tissue&nbsp;problems  of the shoulder, hip, knee and ankle. He&nbsp;has had many years of  experience using gentle osteopathic techniques to help with pain in pregnancy  and post natally.<br>
                <br>
                Mark has also completed a masters in integrated health, a three year training  in acupuncture and a post graduate diploma in diagnostic ultrasound. &nbsp;He  was a senior lecturer at the University of Westminster and from 1995 to  2002&nbsp;was the director of the MSc programmes&nbsp;at the University's  School of Integrated Health. &nbsp;As well as being a member of the research  team at the British School of Osteopathy between 1995 and 1997 he was senior  lecturer in&nbsp;Osteopathic Methods at the London School of Osteopathy '94-97  where he taught musculoskeletal diagnosis and treatment. When he is not  busy at work, Mark loves surfing and keeping fit with his four children.</p>							</div>

            <p class="accordion-header"><strong>Simone Ross BSc Ost BPhil RGN</strong></p>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p><img src="/assets/images/simone.jpg" alt="simone ross" width="161" height="188" hspace="28" vspace="10" align="right" /><span class="email">email:&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:simone@kaneandross.co.uk">simone@kaneandross.co.uk</a></p>
              <p>Simone treats a wide variety of patients from babies to adults using a  combination of cranial and structural techniques as well as postural ergonomic  and exercise advice. She is interested in finding the root of the problem so  that a course of treatment can be devised to relieve the symptoms as soon as  possible and then to prevent them returning by prescribing exercise and  ergonomic advice. Simone is committed to an integrated approach working with  her patients&rsquo; consultants, obstetricians GPs, fitness instructors, etc. to  enable the patient to get the best all-round care.</p>
              <p> Simone has a special interest in treating musculoskeletal pain in  pregnancy and post-natal women. She believes that it is common but not normal  for women to suffer unnecessary pain during pregnancy and post-natally, and  that there are few musculoskeletal symptoms during this time that cannot be  helped by osteopathic treatment.</p>
              <p> Conditions that can be treated well with osteopathy during pregnancy  include:</p>
              <p> Back pain<br />
                Sacro-iliac  pain<br />
                Pelvic pain  (SPD)<br />
                Rib pain<br />
                Headaches</p>
              <p>She also does check ups for newborn babies and has a contract with The  Portland Hospital&nbsp; and will treat them  for conditions such as:</p>
              <p> Feeding  problems<br />
                Colic-  wind, reflux and constipation<br />
                Sleepless  nights<br />
                Sticky eyes<br />
                Plagiocephaly  (flat head)/torticollis</p>
              <p>Conditions  treated in older children may include:</p>
              <p>Ear  infections <br />
                Constant  upper respiratory tract infections <br />
                Headaches<br />
                Neck/back  pain<br />
                <br />
                Simone will do check-ups for newborn babies who can be seen immediately  after they are born which often helps with feeding issues.&nbsp;She receives  referrals from many of the leading obstetricians and paediatricians at London's  private hospitals and may see your baby either within the hospital or at Kane  and Ross Clinics in Harley St W1 or Kensington SW5.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>									Simone has a background in nursing where she specialised in looking  after patients with cancer, and in orthopaedics and paediatrics. She holds a  postgraduate degree in complementary healthcare from Exeter University.</p>
              <p> She has worked for 2 years at the Osteopathic Clinic for Children and  also has also taught osteopathic techniques to post-graduate students. She now  teaches midwives, doctors and pregnant women about osteopathic treatment.</p>
              <p> Simone has four young children of her own.</p></div>

            <p class="accordion-header"><strong>Cecylia Baulkwill  BOst, BSc (Hons)</strong></p>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>Cecylia qualified with  distinction from the British School of Osteopathy in 2008, after a degree in  Physics and ten years in the oil and gas industry. She has subsequently worked  in busy practices in London and Edinburgh treating a wide variety of problems  in patients of all ages.</p>
              <p>Her treatment combines  structural and cranial osteopathy with practical advice and support, including  exercise and ergonomics. Her approach is guided by the osteopathic principle  that health can be enabled by supporting the body&rsquo;s own healing mechanisms.  Cecylia&rsquo;s aim is to ensure each individual achieves their best health state,  relieving pain and symptoms and also working with them to prevent problems  recurring. </p>
              <p>Over recent years, Cecylia  has built up particular expertise in treating expectant mothers, babies and  children of all ages. She has specific obstetric and paediatric training and  also her own experience as a mother to two boys. </p>
              <p>Working with women in  the ante-natal period, helping to support her patients towards the delivery of  their babies, she treats problems that can occur, or be aggravated, during  pregnancy. Such problems include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> pelvic pain</li>
                <li> sciatica</li>
                <li> rib pain</li>
                <li> upper back and neck pain </li>
              </ul>
              <p>In the post-natal  period, mothers and newborns may need to resolve:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> difficulties with suckling and breastfeeding</li>
                <li> neck movement issues (which can lead to plagiocephaly in babies)</li>
                <li> unsettled and windy/&rdquo;colicky&rdquo; babies</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In addition for new  mothers certain problems can persist after delivery, especially when not  treated during pregnancy. This includes pelvic pain and lower back and neck  pain. As with all her patients, Cecylia tailors treatments, advice and support  to the specific needs of each individual whatever their age.</p>
              <p>Cecylia strongly  believes that chronic and recurrent problems can be avoided by helping patients  to identify, understand and manage the factors that contribute to their  patterns of pain and dysfunction.</p>
              <p>Cecylia lives in London with her  husband and two sons and enjoys running, cycling, swimming and sailing. </p>

              <ul>
                <li>  back pain; e.g. related to disc injury or joint strain&nbsp;</li>

              </ul>
              <p> Kristin is passionate about getting to the root cause of these issues for her  patients and working with them to find solutions and build plans that suit  their individual needs. This may include advice about ergonomics, diet, and  exercises to manage&nbsp;conditions day to day, and more importantly, to help  her patients recover as quickly as possible. She is particularly interested in  assisting mothers and infants with their unique challenges.</p>
              <p> Kristin graduated from Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia in 2007, and  worked around Melbourne before moving to the UK.

In 2011 she completed a year of  post graduate training through Victoria University in Paediatric care, and is  currently undertaking a second qualification through the renowned Osteopathic  Centre for Children in London.&nbsp;During her Masters degree Kristin  investigated the relationship between neck and jaw function. She makes use of  her research in this area on a daily basis when working with infants who have  difficulty latching.</p>
              <p>Kristin understands that however small a condition may appear, or however minor  a breakthrough may seem, that breakthrough is often a life changer for the  family involved. This is why she is so passionate about pre and post natal care  for parents and&nbsp;children, and for all her patients - listening to their  needs as a whole, making a full assessment and introducing new ideas to help  manage conditions.</p>

              <p>Charlotte specialises in both structural and cranial  osteopathy&nbsp;techniques and treats a wide variety of patients from babies to  the&nbsp;elderly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Her osteopathic treatments involve hands-on techniques as  well&nbsp;as&nbsp;discussing with patients' potential factors contributing to  their pain and&nbsp;discomfort whether from pregnancy, work, sport, lifestyle  or other&nbsp;factors.&nbsp;&nbsp;She gives tailored postural advice plus  stretching or&nbsp;strengthening exercises to help patients with ongoing  management of&nbsp;their&nbsp;symptoms and prevention of symptom/injury  recurrence. She&nbsp;encourages&nbsp;her patients to play an active part in  their own recovery&nbsp;ensuring a long-term&nbsp;solution rather than just a  quick fix. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>Charlotte places key importance on the overall healthcare of her&nbsp;patients  and works in conjunction with their medical practitioners and&nbsp;specialists  so they are kept informed at all times of their management&nbsp;plans&nbsp;and  progress.</p>
              <p>Charlotte's expertise extends to the treatment of musculoskeletal pain in pregnancy and she works with each patient to create  a&nbsp;posture and exercise&nbsp;management programme as the  pregnancy&nbsp;progresses and for post partum. Common&nbsp;presenting symptoms&nbsp;where  osteopathy treatments can help include rib pain,  back&nbsp;pain,&nbsp;sacro-iliac pain, pelvic pain (SPD), headaches,  indigestion and shallow&nbsp;breathing.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Charlotte treats newborns and children of all ages, including babies with feeding/suckling difficulties,&nbsp;tongue-tie, colic/reflux,  constipation, plagiocephaly (flat&nbsp;head), sleeping&nbsp;issues and general  unsettledness.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>In older children, treatments for general growing development pains in&nbsp;all  areas of the body, developmental speech difficulties, ear  and&nbsp;respiratory&nbsp;tract infections and headaches amongst other  conditions&nbsp;can be effective.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Charlotte retrained as an osteopath after working for 10 years&nbsp;in  the&nbsp;corporate business worlds of Wine and Hospitality PR, Oil and  Gas&nbsp;Conference Research and Energy Insurance Marketing. &nbsp;She also  has&nbsp;an&nbsp;additional BSc (Hons) degree in Food Science and Nutrition  (Home&nbsp;Economics). </p>
