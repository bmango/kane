          <p>We are most grateful to those patients and healthcare professionals who have written testimonials for us and referred to Kane and Ross Clinics for many years.  We hope they can give you some understanding  into the way we work as part of an integrated team with our patients and their healthcare professionals. Kane and Ross clinics have been established for 20 years and it is still a great honour to work with all of you.</p>

              <h5>Dr Tim Ladbrooke  MA, MB, BChir, DCH, MRCGP; London SW5</h5>

              <p>I have worked closely with all members of  the Kane &amp; Ross team and the feedback from my patients is consistently  positive.&nbsp; All of the team develop  excellent rapport with our patients and most important of all, the treatment is  consistently effective.</p>
              <p>Mark has particular expertise in managing  neck pain whilst the rest of the team led by Simone, have special expertise in  managing my paediatric patients &ndash; particularly babies with difficult to control reflux, management of flat heads and wry neck.</p>
              <h5>Dr Ebba Nielsen; Sloane Street SW1</h5>

              <p>As a GP I find the Kane and Ross Osteopathic Clinics an  essential part of my practice. I have referred to the clinic for more than 12  years and have only had positive feedback from patients. The clinics provide a  competent, holistic and up-to-date approach to the patients&rsquo; problems. </p>

              <h5>Dr Sabrina Pao MBBS BSc DFFP MRCGP DipOccMed; Sloane Street SW1</h5>


              <p>I have been referring to Kane and Ross for 5 years and they  have proved successful in managing my patients&rsquo; wide variety of problems  ranging from back pain to baby&nbsp;reflux. &nbsp;I can think of a particular  episode of a patient with severe back pain who Mark saw on a weekend for  treatment and once he realised the severity of the problem,&nbsp;he facilitated  their admission to hospital which was very critical for this patient. &nbsp; As  a GP it is important to have a good network of referrals that are both high in  quality but&nbsp;also good availability and this is certainly reflected by the  excellent feedback I get from my patients that go to Kane and Ross.</p>

              <h5>Dr Elaine Tickle MRCGP MA; Harley Street, London</h5>

              <p>I am  very happy when my patients undertake treatments with Kane and Ross as they are  seen soon,&nbsp;treated effectively and offered an all round high quality  professional service with a high rate of resolution of symptoms, especially  pain. </p>
              <p>I am  delighted to refer my patients here.&nbsp;</p>

              <h5>Mr Karl Murphy MD FRCOG FRCPI DCH; St Mary's Hospital and The Portland Hospital, London</h5>

              <p>I have been referring patients to Kane and Ross Osteopaths for  more than 13 years now and have never had a client who was not happy with the  service. As a well organised team providing a first class service, they have  enabled many of my patients to remain mobile throughout pregnancy when they  have had to cope with pregnancy problems such as sciatica, low back pain and  pelvic girdle pain.</p>
              <p>For all their help over the years I would like to say a big  thank you.</p>
              <h5>Jeffrey Braithwaite MB BCH MD FRCOG; The Portland Hospital, London</h5>

              <p>I have known Simone for at least 12 years. She has always been  the first port of call for nearly all of the pregnant women I look after who  get bad backs and associated discomfort in the legs, shoulders and joints. She  has looked after hundreds of women for me over the years and has always been a  wonderful support in this respect to both myself and the women. </p>

              <h5>Clare Byam-Cook; Midwife, Author of <em>'What to Expect When You're Breast-feeding.....and What if you Can't?'</em></h5>

              <p>I first heard about Simone Ross through one of her grateful clients. Since then I have referred many mothers to Kane & Ross Clinics and the feedback has always been extremely positive. I highly recommend them to any new mother.</p>

              <h5>Karen Eichhorn RGN RM; Midwife at St Mary's Hospital</h5>

              <p>Simone Ross has a special way with newborns and is passionate  about the work she does.&nbsp;I have great respect for Simone and her work and would  really recommend her as an osteopath. </p>
              <h5>Beth Graham; Lactation Consultant</h5>

              <p>I refer my clients to Kane and Ross for Osteopathy and the  feedback is always positive, &nbsp;I notice a difference with feeding and the  general condition of the baby after treatment.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>I refer clients whose babies have feeding problems - when  their&nbsp;baby cannot&nbsp;open their mouth very wide, have an uncoordinated  suck, including tongue thrusting and tongue tie.&nbsp;Also for babies with  digestive discomfort that may be impacting on feeding mechanics and  have&nbsp;bloated abdomens that are full of gas.&nbsp;Kane and Ross treatment  always involves gentle hands on treatment and they teach the family abdominal  massage techniques to use at home to help release lower wind.&nbsp;All members  of the team are kind and empathetic and the mums and babies feel better after  the treatments. </p>
              <p>I also send babies for osteopathic treatment &nbsp;if the baby  prefers to lie with their head&nbsp;facing one way or will feed off one breast,  more than another as this can be a result of a restriction in their necks and  &nbsp;lead to plagiocephaly (flat head) &nbsp; </p>

              <p>Kane and Ross offer excellent osteopathy for mother and newborn  baby &nbsp;and I feel all mums and new babies should be seen by a member of the  team shortly after birth. </p>

              <h5>Lisa Rabbe, Financial Services Professional</h5>

              <p>I was referred to the  clinic by my GP for lower back trouble following a car accident, for which  various physiotherapy attempts had failed to produce results.  Simone Ross and her team zeroed in on the  problem and were able to fully address it in a matter of weeks. </p>
              <p>I have learned an enormous  amount about how the various areas of the body cross-reference, and am always  impressed by the practitioners' knowledge and ability to get to the root of the  problem, rather than just treat the symptoms.</p>
              <p>Having had experience of a  number of the Kane and Ross practitioners, I can say that they are all  excellent, and have a consistently high standard in their approach to treating  me, but each brings something special.   Some have demonstrated a knack for cranial osteopathic treatment, others  excel at repositioning out of alignment areas using the super slow movement  which is one of the features of osteopathy that continues to amaze me.  </p>
              <p>My professional life  involves extensive travel, and my posture is challenged from this, and from  years of &quot;driving a desk&quot; for a living.  The combination of osteopathy and the pilates  Simone recommended I take up early on in our discussions, have transformed my  posture, body awareness, energy and ability to perform in a high stress work  environment.</p>
              <p>The team's flexibility and  willingness to do late evenings and Saturdays has made a huge difference to my  ability to maintain a treatment schedule.</p>
              <h5>James E. Hughes-Hallett</h5>
              <p>Amongst the myriad of osteopaths and physiotherapists I have visited over the years, I have never felt more confident than when visiting Mark Kane that my back, neck, hip or other skeletal problems will soon be resolved. Mark's analysis of the issue and systematic approach to resolution ensure that I am back on the road promptly and importantly less likely to return.</p>
              <h5>Sophie Muir </h5>
              <p>Our son was 6 months old, he had a  severe case of flat head syndrome (plagiocephaly). &nbsp;Simone and her team at  Kane and Ross were instrumental in treating him and he now has a beautiful  round head. &nbsp;The suggested course of treatments worked. The communication  thought out the process was flawless. We are grateful to Simone and her team  and recommend them highly.</p>
              <h5>Jo Jackson</h5>
              <p>In my little black book  Simone is simply one of the most important people in my life, and her  treatments have helped my family immeasurably.   Her newborn check-ups and treatments worked wonders on both my  children's digestive issues, breathing and sleep, and she has helped me with  numerous issues such as back and neck pain and for musculoskeletal problems  during pregnancy.  Her ability to target  the root cause of the issue and alleviate pain is second to none, as is her  lovely bedside manner.  I can't recommend  her highly enough.</p>
              <h5>Ralph Firman</h5>
              <p>I originally brought my  daughter to Simone Ross at Kane &amp; Ross Clinic at a few weeks of age for  osteopathy to help with colic as well as slight torticollis. After our first  session there was drastic improvement. After each session we noticed a  difference. As a sports professional I was myself suffering after a few  sporting accidents, and as part of my profession need to be in top performance  condition, but I also needed to trust the person I was working with - after my  first session with Charlotte Hunt I noticed a vast improvement and I am getting  back to peak performance. Charlotte managed to diagnose old sporting injuries  and really find the root of the problem, which was not necessarily what I  thought was the root. </p>
              <p>Since then my wife has also  started seeing Charlotte for post natal treatment combined with personal  training. The expertise, professionalism and outstanding results from the team  at Kane &amp; Ross has made a drastic improvement to all of our lives, probably  the best choice and best decision we have made in terms of physical wellbeing  and health."</p>
              <h5>Sarah Al Khabbaz </h5>
              <p>Meeting Simone was one of  the best things I have experienced for my family - their clinic did wonders for  me and cured my knee pain, and fixed my husband's neck pain and my 13 year old  daughter's and my 60 year old mother's back pain. We have known Simone for five  years now and I have recommended them to all my friends , and everyone loved  their work. Many thanks Simone.</p>
              <h5>Milo Vandemoortele </h5>
              <p>Thanks to Katie's skills,  I've been able to manage my pelvic girdle pain and enjoy my pregnancy. At  around 12 weeks I found myself with such unbearable pelvic girdle pain I was  unable to walk.  Desperate, I went to see  Katie, who reassured me that what I had read online, was untrue. This pain can  be managed and pregnancy enjoyed. With her treatment, the pain subsided and I've  been swimming, cycling, doing Pilates and walking since (I'm now 37  weeks).  The treatment I received has  been excellent and holistic - not only did Katie treat my joints and muscles,  she also suggested approaches to manage the pain at home and was always  positive. I am very grateful to Katie for her support.</p>
              <h5>Stephanie Achar</h5>
              <p>I have been extremely happy  with the quality of the treatments I have had at Kane and Ross Clinics.  I feel like the sessions of osteopathy have  really helped me have a better posture and improve my condition overall.  I got a lot of relief from the work done at  the clinic. </p>
              <h5>Emma van Klaveren Finlay</h5>
              <p>We were recommended  Charlotte at Kane &amp; Ross by my lactation consultant, shortly after the  birth of my daughter, as we were having breastfeeding and sleeping problems.  Charlotte diagnosed and treated our baby for her anterior tongue tie therefore  facilitating breastfeeding and avoiding an unpleasant medical procedure for our  baby. She also treated my caesarian wound with osteopathic techniques reducing  swelling and aiding healing. Charlotte was extremely caring, professional and  very helpful-we could not recommend her more highly.</p>
              <h5>Myriam Louis</h5>
              <p>My  little boy had severe torticollis, which means the right side of his neck  muscles were shorter than the left. He also had a really noticeable flat head (plagiocephaly).</p>
              <p>I had  no experience with osteopathy, but I wanted to try something which could help  my baby. &nbsp;Soon as my baby had the treatment with Simone he could relax,  turn his head to the right and I noticed a difference in his head shape very  quickly.</p>
              <p>After  long research, and after going to the wrong people I found Simone Ross.  Simone is experienced and my little boy is  very relaxed when he sees her.&nbsp;My only regret is that I didn't start  earlier as he was already 5 months when he was first treated.</p>
              <p>My  husband and my in-laws couldn't believe it. &nbsp;For the first time after  &nbsp;long weeks of feeling unable to help my baby boy, I was able to smile  again.</p>
              <p>My  baby is now able to turn his head to both sides with no restriction, he can sit  properly and his flat head is no longer noticeable.</p>
              <p>To  the question, does osteopathy work? I answer, not necessary, you have to find  someone really experienced with babies. From the bottom of my heart I would  like to thank Ms Simone Ross.</p>
              <h5>Julia,  mother of 3</h5>
              <p>My  family and I have been regularly attending the Kane &amp; Ross clinic for over  6 years now and it never ceases to amaze me how professional, kind and  accommodating their practitioners are. We've seen them for pregnancy-related  issues, post-partum check ups for babies and mum, back and neck problems,  developmental problems, sports injuries, plantar fasciitis and even ear  infections (adult and kids), and in each case, the effect of the treatment was  excellent. I cannot recommend this clinic enough.</p>
